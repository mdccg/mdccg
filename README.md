Since 2018, I have been a scholarship student through the Institutional Scientific Initiation Scholarship Program
(known in Brazil by the acronym PIBIC). In addition to the software projects developed during both courses, I
actively participated in teaching projects aimed at software development, among which I may mention:

- ### [_Kalivôno: promovendo o acesso à língua Terena por meio de um app progressivo_](https://kalivono-app.web.app) (2019-current);
  &quot;Child: promoting access to the Terena language through a progressive app&quot; from Terena and brazilian
  portuguese. This app consisted of a dictionary to revitalize the Terena language, that is, an indigenous
  language, and provide easy and modern means for its diffusion.

- ### _Desenvolvimento de um aplicativo para acompanhamento dos egressos do IFMS_ (2021-2022).
  &quot;Development of an app to accompany graduates of the Federal Institute of _Mato Grosso do Sul_&quot; from
  brazilian portuguese. This app is a business social network for graduates of the Federal Institute of
  _Mato Grosso do Sul_. Its objective is to collect course reviews, provide jobs and encourage them to continue in
  the institution through other courses or selection processes so that they may join the institution as employees.

- ### _IFMS Aqui Comunica_: Scrum (2018);
  &quot;_IFMS_ Here It Communicates: Scrum&quot; from brazilian portuguese. This project
  was focused on developing an event website for the institution using the Scrum
  methodoogy. It received accreditation for the Technology, Engineering and
  Science Fair of _Mato Grosso do Sul_ (known by the acronym FETECMS),
  considered the largest scientific event in the Brazilian Midwest
  region.

On top of that, I am focused on maintaining my detailed repositories in order to clearly demonstrate the activities carried out during my classes, as well as what I have learned and how it can contribute to those who want to explore my skills.

For proposals, invitations, doubts or distress signals, I leave here my means of contact:
