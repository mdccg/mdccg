## About me

<img align="left" alt="Graduation cap" width="64px" src="./assets/graduation-cap.svg" />

I'm [computer technician](https://www.ifms.edu.br/campi/campus-aquidauana/cursos/integrado/informatica) (2017-2020)
and a future [technologist in Internet Systems](https://www.ifms.edu.br/campi/campus-aquidauana/cursos/graduacao/sistemas-para-internet/sistemas-para-internet)
(2021-2024) by [Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of _Mato Grosso do Sul_](https://ifms.edu.br)
_campus Aquidauana_.

Since 2018, I have been a scholarship student through the Institutional Scientific Initiation Scholarship Program
(known in Brazil by the acronym PIBIC). In addition to the software projects developed during both courses, I
actively participated in teaching projects aimed at software development, among which I may mention:

- ### IFMS Aqui Comunica: Scrum (2018);
  Which was focused on developing an event website for the institution using
  the Scrum methodology.

- ### [_Kalivôno: promovendo o acesso à língua Terena por meio de um app progressivo_](https://kalivono-app.web.app) (2019-2020);
  &quot;Child: promoting access to the Terena language through a progressive app&quot; from Terena and brazilian
  portuguese. This app consisted of a dictionary to revitalize the Terena language, that is, an indigenous
  language, and provide easy and modern means for its diffusion.

- ### _Desenvolvimento de um aplicativo para acompanhamento dos egressos do IFMS_ (2021-2022).
  &quot;Development of an app to accompany graduates of the Federal Institute of _Mato Grosso do Sul_&quot; from
  brazilian portuguese. This app is a business social network for graduates of the Federal Institute of
  _Mato Grosso do Sul_. Its objective is to collect course reviews, provide jobs and encourage them to continue in
  the institution through other courses or selection processes so that they may join the institution as employees.

Here are some web projects I've developed and hosted through the Firebase service, and their source code is also available in the following repositories for a peek. In addition to these, there are also other non-web-oriented projects on my GitHub.
